# what is linux ? 
the definition of linux depends on the context , but generally linux is the **kernel** of a O.system , 
and the **kernel** is a the controller of everything that happens on the computer

**GNU** is a free software operating system , a Unix-like system entirely composed of free software made by Richard Stallman in 1983

The ```Linux OS``` that we know today includes both the **Linux kernel and GNU tools** (this kernel is made by Linus Torvalds in 1991)

so really , linux is not Unix 

> Often the license explicitly says that you may not attempt to reverse engineer ```the machine code``` back to ```source code``` to figure out what it does!
