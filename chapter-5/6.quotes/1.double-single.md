lesson on **double quotes** and **single quotes** in Linux. I'll explain with simple words and examples so it's easy to follow.

### **What Are Double Quotes?**
Double quotes (`" "`) protect most special characters, like `*`, `?`, and `[ ]`. These characters, called **globs** or **wildcards**, usually have special meanings in the shell. For example:  
- `*` matches multiple filenames.  
- `?` matches a single character.  
- `[ ]` matches specific character ranges.

When you use **double quotes**, these special characters lose their special meaning and are treated as plain text.  

#### **Example 1**  
Without quotes:  
```bash
echo The glob characters are *, ? and [ ]
```
The shell might try to interpret `*` and `?` as wildcards and look for matching files in the current directory.  

With double quotes:  
```bash
echo "The glob characters are *, ? and [ ]"
```
Output:  
```
The glob characters are *, ? and [ ]
```
Now, the shell just prints the text without trying to interpret anything.

**But!** Double quotes still allow some shell features, like:  
1. **Variable Substitution** – Replace variables with their values.  
   ```bash
   echo "My path is $PATH"
   ```
   Output:  
   ```
   My path is /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin
   ```

2. **Command Substitution** – Run commands and use their output.  
   ```bash
   echo "Today is $(date)"
   ```
   Output:  
   ```
   Today is Sat Dec 14 2024
   ```

### **What Are Single Quotes?**
Single quotes (`' '`) are stricter than double quotes. They protect **everything** inside them. No substitutions, no special characters—everything is treated as plain text.  

#### **Example 2**  
Without quotes:  
```bash
echo The car costs $100
```
Output:  
```
The car costs 00
```
Here, `$100` makes the shell think `$1` is a variable, but since it doesn't exist, it removes `$` and `1`.

With single quotes:  
```bash
echo 'The car costs $100'
```
Output:  
```
The car costs $100
```
Now, `$` is treated as plain text, not as a variable.

### **When to Use Which?**  
- Use **double quotes** (`" "`) when you want to allow variable or command substitution but protect other special characters like `*`, `?`, `[ ]`.  
- Use **single quotes** (`' '`) when you want to protect everything inside the quotes and treat it as plain text.

#### **Quick Summary Table**  

| **Feature**         | **Double Quotes (" ")**                     | **Single Quotes (' ')**        |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Protect globbing     | Yes                                         | Yes                             |
| Variable substitution | Yes (`$VAR` replaced by its value)         | No (`$VAR` treated as plain text) |
| Command substitution | Yes (`$(command)` replaced by output)       | No                              |
| Everything plain text| No (some features still work)               | Yes                             |
