### **Backquotes**

Backquotes, or backticks, are used to specify a command within a command, a process called **command substitution**. This allows for powerful and sophisticated use of commands.

#### **Example 1: The Output of `date` Command**
To begin, note the output of the `date` command:  
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ date                                           
Mon Nov  4 03:35:50 UTC 2018
```

#### **Example 2: Using `echo` Without Backquotes**
Now, note the output of the `echo` command:  
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo Today is date                               
Today is date
```
In the previous command, the word `date` is treated as regular text, and the shell passes `date` to the `echo` command. 

---

#### **Example 3: Using Backquotes for Command Substitution**
To execute the `date` command and have the output of that command sent to the `echo` command, put the `date` command in between two backquote characters:  
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo Today is `date`                         
Today is Mon Nov 4 03:40:04 UTC 2018
```
