### 5.5.3 Aliases  

Aliases are shortcuts that map longer commands to shorter, simpler sequences. When the shell executes an alias, it substitutes the defined longer command before interpreting it.  

#### Benefits of Using Aliases  
Aliases make repetitive tasks faster and easier. For instance, the command `ls -l` is often aliased to `l` or `ll`, saving typing effort while maintaining functionality.  

---

#### Viewing Current Aliases  
To see the aliases currently active in the shell, use the `alias` command:  

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ alias
alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

These aliases are typically defined by initialization files (e.g., `.bashrc`) to ensure they are automatically created when the shell starts.  

---

#### Creating New Aliases  
You can create your own alias using the following format:  
```bash
alias name='command'
```

**Example**:  
Suppose you frequently use the command `cal 2019` to view the calendar for 2019. Instead of typing it each time, you can create an alias:  

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ alias mycal="cal 2019"
sysadmin@localhost:~$ mycal
                            2019
      January               February               March
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
       1  2  3  4  5                  1  2                  1  2
 6  7  8  9 10 11 12   3  4  5  6  7  8  9   3  4  5  6  7  8  9
13 14 15 16 17 18 19  10 11 12 13 14 15 16  10 11 12 13 14 15 16
20 21 22 23 24 25 26  17 18 19 20 21 22 23  17 18 19 20 21 22 23
27 28 29 30 31        24 25 26 27 28        24 25 26 27 28 29 30
                                            31
```

---

#### Persistence of Aliases  
Aliases created during a session only last as long as the shell remains open. When the shell is closed, these aliases are lost. Similarly, each shell session maintains its own set of aliases, meaning aliases defined in one shell will not carry over to another.  

To make aliases persistent, they need to be added to a shell initialization file like `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`.  

---

#### Using the `type` Command with Aliases  
The `type` command can reveal whether a command is an alias and what it maps to:  

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ type ll
ll is aliased to `ls -alF'

sysadmin@localhost:~$ type -a ls
ls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'
ls is /bin/ls
```

The output indicates:  
- `ll` is an alias for `ls -alF`.  
- Even the `ls` command itself is aliased to `ls --color=auto`.  

By effectively using aliases, you can streamline your workflow and simplify repetitive commands.
