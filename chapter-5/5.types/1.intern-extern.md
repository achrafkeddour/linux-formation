### 5.5 Command Types  

Understanding the origin of a command helps determine how it is executed. The `type` command is useful for identifying the type of a command in the shell.

#### Command Sources in the Shell  
The shell (Command-Line Interface) recognizes commands from four primary sources:  
1. **Internal Commands**  
2. **External Commands**  
3. **Aliases**  
4. **Functions**

### 5.5.1 Internal Commands  
Internal commands, also known as built-in commands, are integrated into the shell itself. These commands are executed directly by the shell without invoking any external programs.  

**Example**: The `cd` (change directory) command is an internal command in the Bash shell. When a user runs the `cd` command, Bash interprets it natively.  

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin
```

---

### 5.5.2 External Commands  
External commands are standalone executable files stored in directories defined by the `PATH` environment variable. The shell searches these directories to locate and execute the command.

#### Identifying Command Paths  
The `which` command displays the full path of an external command by searching the `PATH` variable.  

**Example**:  
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ which ls
/bin/ls

sysadmin@localhost:~$ which cal
/usr/bin/cal
```

#### Executing External Commands  
You can execute an external command by specifying its full path:  
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ /bin/ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

#### Using the `type` Command for External Commands  
The `type` command can also display the location of external commands:  
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ type cal
cal is /usr/bin/cal
```

#### Discrepancies Between `type` and `which`  
Sometimes, the `type` command identifies a command as a shell built-in, while the `which` command points to an external version:  
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ type echo
echo is a shell builtin

sysadmin@localhost:~$ which echo
/bin/echo
```

#### Using the `-a` Option with `type`  
The `-a` option of the `type` command lists all locations of a command, whether built-in or external:  
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ type -a echo
echo is a shell builtin
echo is /bin/echo
```

By understanding command types and using tools like `type` and `which`, you can gain insights into how commands are executed and troubleshoot issues effectively.
