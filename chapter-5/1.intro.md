## What is a Shell?
- A shell is a command line interpreter.
- It takes user commands, translates them, and interacts with the operating system.
- Outputs results or error messages in the terminal.

## Common Shell: Bash
- **Bash** is the most popular shell in Linux.
- Features include:
  - **Command History**: Reuse previous commands easily.
  - **Inline Editing**: Modify commands before running.

### Key Bash Features
1. **Scripting**: Run multiple commands from a file with programming-like features (e.g., conditions, functions).
2. **Aliases**: Short nicknames for long commands.
