### Understanding the PATH Variable in Bash

The PATH variable in Bash is crucial as it defines the directories the shell searches to locate executable commands. If a command results in a "command not found" error, it means the shell couldn't find the command in any of the directories listed in the PATH.

#### Displaying the PATH Variable
To view the current PATH variable:
```bash
echo $PATH
```
Example output:
```
/home/sysadmin/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
```

The directories in the PATH are separated by colons (`:`) and checked sequentially. For example:
- `/home/sysadmin/bin`
- `/usr/local/sbin`
- `/usr/local/bin`
- `/usr/sbin`
- `/usr/bin`
- `/sbin`
- `/bin`
- `/usr/games`

#### The Role of Paths
Paths act as navigation addresses in the filesystem, specifying the location of files or directories. If a command isn't found in the directories listed in PATH, the shell returns an error:
```bash
-bash: command_name: command not found
```

#### Modifying the PATH Variable
Custom software installations may require updating the PATH variable to include new directories. For instance:
```bash
PATH=/usr/bin/custom:$PATH
```
This adds `/usr/bin/custom` to the beginning of the PATH. Always include `$PATH` in the update to retain access to previously listed directories.

#### Key Tips:
- Use `:` to separate directories in PATH.
- Ensure the current PATH is appended during updates to avoid losing access to existing commands.
