### Environment Variables in Linux

#### **Definition**
Environment variables (also known as global variables) are accessible throughout the system and in all Bash shell sessions. They are automatically recreated each time a new shell session is opened.  

**Common examples:**
- **`PATH`**: Specifies directories to search for commands.  
- **`HOME`**: Refers to the user's home directory.  
- **`HISTSIZE`**: Determines the number of commands stored in the shell history.

#### **Viewing and Modifying Variables**
- **View the value of a variable**:  
  ```bash
  echo $HISTSIZE
  ```

- **Modify an existing variable**:  
  ```bash
  HISTSIZE=500
  echo $HISTSIZE
  ```

#### **Related Commands**

1. **List Environment Variables**:  
   ```bash
   env
   ```
   **Tip**: Use filters to narrow down the output. For example:  
   ```bash
   env | grep <variable_name>
   ```

2. **Create or Promote a Local Variable to an Environment Variable**:
   - **Promote an existing local variable**:  
     ```bash
     export variable1
     ```
   - **Directly create an environment variable**:  
     ```bash
     export variable2='Value'
     ```

   **Example of modifying with multiple variables**:  
   ```bash
   variable1=$variable1' '$variable2
   echo $variable1
   ```

3. **Remove an Exported Variable**:  
   ```bash
   unset variable2
   ```

Environment variables are critical tools for configuring the system's behavior and ensuring consistent settings across sessions and applications.
