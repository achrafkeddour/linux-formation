**Email**
The Mozilla Foundation came out with ```Thunderbird``` , a full-featured desktop email client. Thunderbird ```connects to a POP or IMAP server, displays email locally```, and ```sends email through an external SMTP server```. 
Other notable email clients are **Evolution and KMail** which are the GNOME and KDE projects' email clients.
