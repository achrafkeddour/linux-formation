# The Cloud

The cloud is where we store and access data and applications over a network (today : the internet). You might use the cloud without even realizing it, like when using Google Docs or iCloud.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the process of moving data and computing power to remote servers, allowing us to access them from anywhere. Itâ€™s important for organizations because it lets them manage and store their data without needing to handle physical servers.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing:
- Access from anywhere with an internet connection.
- No need to maintain physical servers or infrastructure.
- Flexibility to scale resources up or down as needed.
- Delegate IT infrastructure management to third-party providers.

## Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud deployment models define how cloud infrastructure is built, managed, and accessed. There are four (4) main types:

1. **Public Cloud**  
   - Services are provided over the internet to anyone.
   - Multiple users (tenants) share resources.
   - Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud.

2. **Private Cloud**  
   - Cloud infrastructure is dedicated to one organization.
   - Offers more control and privacy compared to public cloud.
   - Hosted either on company servers or through managed private cloud providers like IBM or Rackspace.

3. **Community Cloud**  
   - Shared by several organizations with similar needs or goals.
   - Higher cost than public cloud but offers more control and security.
   - Common for organizations with shared interests, like government or healthcare.

4. **Hybrid Cloud**  
   - A mix of two or more clouds (public, private, or community).
   - Allows data and applications to move between clouds, offering flexibility.
   - Organizations can keep sensitive data in a private cloud while using public cloud for other resources.
