## Package management
Every Linux system needs to ```add, remove, and update``` software. 
- In the past this meant ```downloading the source code, setting it up, compiling it, and copying files``` onto each system that required updating.
- Thankfully, **modern** distributions use **packages**, some **compressed files** that bundle up an application and its dependencies,
- simplifying the installation by making the right directories, copying the proper files into them, and creating such needed items as symbolic links.

A **P.manager** track which files belong to which package and even downloading updates from repositories, typically a remote server sharing out the appropriate updates for a distribution.
In Linux, there are many different software package management systems, but the two most popular are those from Debian and Red Hat.

### Debian Package Management
**Debian Package Management** is used in systems like Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint to handle software installation and updates. Software is packaged into files with a ".deb" extension.

The most basic way to manage these packages is with the **dpkg** command, but it can be hard for beginners. To make things easier, tools like **apt-get** (which works on top of dpkg) simplify the process. Other helpful tools include **aptitude** for command-line users and graphical tools like **Synaptic** and **Software Center** for a more user-friendly experience.
