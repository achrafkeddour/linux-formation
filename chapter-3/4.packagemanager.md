## Package management
Every Linux system needs to ```add, remove, and update``` software. 
- In the past this meant ```downloading the source code, setting it up, compiling it, and copying files``` onto each system that required updating.
- Thankfully, **modern** distributions use **packages**, some **compressed files** that bundle up an application and its dependencies,
- simplifying the installation by making the right directories, copying the proper files into them, and creating such needed items as symbolic links.

A **P.manager** track which files belong to which package and even downloading updates from repositories, typically a remote server sharing out the appropriate updates for a distribution.
In Linux, there are many different software package management systems, but the two most popular are those from Debian and Red Hat.

## Debian Package Management
---
**Debian Package Management** is used in systems like Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint to handle software installation and updates. Software is packaged into files with a ".deb" extension.

The most basic way to manage these packages is with the **dpkg** command, but it can be hard for beginners. To make things easier, tools like **apt-get** (which works on top of dpkg) simplify the process. Other helpful tools include **aptitude** for command-line users and graphical tools like **Synaptic** and **Software Center** for a more user-friendly experience.

## RPM Package Management

**RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)** is a package management system used in Linux. It helps manage software packages by handling installation, updating, and removal.

### Key Points:
- **Linux Standards Base (LSB)**: A project aimed at improving compatibility between Linux systems. LSB defines RPM as the standard package management system.
  
- **Distributions Using RPM**:
  - **Red Hat-based**: CentOS, Fedora
  - **Other Distros**: SUSE, OpenSUSE, Arch

- **Package Tracking**:  
  RPM tracks **dependencies** between packages. This ensures that:
  - When installing a package, all necessary packages are also installed. Software updates and removals are done correctly.

### RPM Commands and Tools:
- **rpm command**:  
  This is the **back-end tool** used for:
  - Installing packages
  - Updating packages
  - Querying (checking) installed packages
  - Removing packages

- **Front-end Tools** (simplify tasks by automating dependency handling):
  - **Command Line**: 
    - `yum`
    - `up2date`
  - **Graphical Interface (GUI)**:
    - **Yumex**
    - **Gnome PackageKit**

### ZYpp (libzypp) Package Management:
- Some distributions (like openSUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise, MeeGo, Tizen, Sailfish) use the **ZYpp** package management system.
- **zypper command**: 
  - Example: `zypper in packagename` (installs a package and its dependencies).

### Root Privileges:
- Most package management commands require **root access** (administrator privileges).
  - Regular users can search or query packages.
  - To install, update, or remove packages, you need to be the root user.
