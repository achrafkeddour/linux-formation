## Security Basics

When you browse the web, you leave a **digital footprint**. Some of this data is used for advertising, while some can be exploited for harmful purposes. Protecting your data is crucial.

## 1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords
- Use a **password manager** like **KeePassX** to generate and store passwords.
  - You’ll only need to remember:
    - Your computer’s login password.
    - The password to open your KeePassX file.
## 2. Share Only Necessary Information
- Only provide sites with the **information they absolutely need**.
- Personal data like your **mother’s maiden name** or **birthdate** can help unlock accounts, but it also increases your risk of identity theft.
## 3. Keep Your System Updated
- **Regular updates** are critical for security.
- Configure your system to **check for updates automatically**.
- Always install **security updates** immediately when prompted.
## 4. Protect Your Computer from Unwanted Connections
- Use a **firewall** to block harmful network traffic.
- On Linux, you have a built-in firewall called **iptables**.
  - If you’re using **Ubuntu**, try the graphical interface **Gufw** to manage the firewall easily.
  - **iptables** is powerful, but **Gufw** simplifies the process for most users.

It’s important to implement these tools to protect users and systems.
## 1. Key Privacy Tools

### a. **Encryption**
- **Encryption** is a widely used privacy tool that secures data.
- It uses **authentication keys** to protect communications.
- A common example is **HTTPS**, which secures data transmitted between users and web servers, preventing interception.

### b. **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**
- **VPNs** create an encrypted channel between two systems.
- This encryption scrambles data, making it difficult for outsiders to access it.
- They have been used by companies and are becoming popular among regular users for online privacy.

### c. **Tor Project**
- The **Tor Browser** is a tool designed to enhance privacy.
- It relays internet requests through a network of servers, hiding the user’s identity from websites and trackers.

## 2. Evolving Privacy Tools
- Privacy tools are constantly changing and improving.
- Choosing the right tools is a critical responsibility for systems administrators to ensure user and system security.
