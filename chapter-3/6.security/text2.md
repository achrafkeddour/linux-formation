# Linux Essentials: Security Basics

When you browse the web, you leave a **digital footprint**. Some of this data is used for advertising, while some can be exploited for harmful purposes. Protecting your data is crucial.

## 1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords
- A **strong password** should:
  - Be at least **10 characters long**.
  - Include **numbers**, **upper and lower case letters**, and **special symbols**.
- Use a **password manager** like **KeePassX** to generate and store passwords.
  - You’ll only need to remember:
    - Your computer’s login password.
    - The password to open your KeePassX file.

## 2. Share Only Necessary Information
- Only provide sites with the **information they absolutely need**.
- Personal data like your **mother’s maiden name** or **birthdate** can help unlock accounts, but it also increases your risk of identity theft.

## 3. Keep Your System Updated
- **Regular updates** are critical for security.
- Configure your system to **check for updates automatically**.
- Always install **security updates** immediately when prompted.

## 4. Protect Your Computer from Unwanted Connections
- Use a **firewall** to block harmful network traffic.
- On Linux, you have a built-in firewall called **iptables**.
  - If you’re using **Ubuntu**, try the graphical interface **Gufw** to manage the firewall easily.
  - **iptables** is powerful, but **Gufw** simplifies the process for most users.
