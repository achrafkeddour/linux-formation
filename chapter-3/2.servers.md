## web servers
A **web server** hosts content for web pages, which are viewed by a web browser using HTTP or its encrypted flavor, HTTPS.
- When web browser requests a **static page**, the web server sends the file as it appears on disk. 
- In the case of a **dynamic site**, the request is sent by the web server to an application, which generates the content.

> examples : Apache HTTPD is the daemon , Nginx (they work in a local network by default , but can be configured to internet)
