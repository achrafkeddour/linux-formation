## web servers
A **web server** hosts content for web pages, which are viewed by a web browser using HTTP or its encrypted flavor, HTTPS.
- When web browser requests a **static page**, the web server sends the file as it appears on disk. 
- In the case of a **dynamic site**, the request is sent by the web server to an application, which generates the content.

> examples : Apache HTTPD is the daemon , Nginx (they work in a local network by default , but can be configured to internet)

## cloud servers
- Cloud servers like **ownCloud and Nextcloud** are **self-hosted** platforms for storing, syncing, and sharing files across devices. 
- They allow users to **control their data**, offering **collaboration tools** while maintaining privacy and security. Essentially, they function as personal or business cloud storage solutions.
> they are also working in a local network by default , but can be configured to internet

## Database Servers
- Database servers **store and manage** data for online services, allowing applications to **read, write, and query information**.
- MariaDB, a fork of MySQL, is one popular database among others like PostgreSQL and Firebird. SQL is used to retrieve and aggregate data, such as generating reports from sales figures.

## Linux Email Servers
To manage email on a Linux server, three essential components are needed:
#### 1. **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)**
- Transfers email between systems.
- Examples: **Sendmail** (widely used), **Postfix** (simpler, more secure).
#### 2. **Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)**
- Stores emails in the user’s mailbox.
- Usually invoked by the final MTA.
#### 3. **POP/IMAP Servers**
- Allow email clients to retrieve messages from the server.
- Examples: **Dovecot** (easy to use), **Cyrus IMAP** (more advanced).

Some POP/IMAP servers offer custom mail databases and may include their own MDA for performance optimization.
#### Open Source vs Closed Source Solutions
- **Closed Source (e.g., Microsoft Exchange)**: A single-package solution with all components integrated, offering limited customization.
- **Open Source**: Flexible and modular; users can swap out individual components (MTA, MDA, POP/IMAP) to fit their needs, often combining them into custom setups.

## File Sharing

- **Samba**: Ideal for Windows file sharing. Enables Linux to act like a Windows machine for file sharing and domain participation, handling both server and client roles.
- **Netatalk**: Allows Linux to serve as a Macintosh file server.
- **NFS (Network File System)**: The native UNIX/Linux file sharing protocol. It integrates remote filesystems as if they were local disks, making access seamless.
### Network Directories

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates domain names (e.g., [https://www.icann.org/](https://www.icann.org/)) into IP addresses (e.g., `192.0.43.7`). Often used as a public-facing and internal service directory. The most widely-used DNS server is maintained by the Internet Software Consortium and is known as **bind**.
- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**: A widely-used directory system for storing information like user accounts and roles. LDAP underpins systems like Microsoft’s Active Directory. In Linux, **OpenLDAP** is commonly used
- **DHCP** : giving ip addresses(and other configurations) dynamically to users in a network , we use **ISC-DHCP**
