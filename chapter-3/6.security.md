# Security Essentials - Cookies and Privacy

## Overview
In today's world, both administrators and users are more aware of privacy issues. Data breaches and hacks are common, costing companies millions. Many of these breaches are caused by human errors, like clicking on suspicious emails or entering passwords into fake login pages.

### Cookies
- **Cookies** are small pieces of text that websites use to track your activity.
- They help with useful things, like:
  - Keeping track of items in your shopping cart.
  - Keeping you logged in when you return to a website.
  
### How Cookies Work
1. When you visit a website, it sends a cookie to your browser along with the webpage.
2. Your browser stores the cookie and sends it back to the website on your next visit.
3. Cookies are only sent to the website that created them (e.g., cookies from `example.com` won't be sent to `example.org`).

### Third-Party Cookies
- Some websites embed **third-party scripts**, like ads or analytics (e.g., Google Analytics).
- These scripts can use **third-party cookies** to track you across different websites.
  - For example, if both `example.com` and `example.org` use the same ad service, the service knows you visited both.
  - This allows advertisers to build a profile of your interests and browsing habits.

## Privacy and Security Concerns
- Tracking cookies can be used to learn about your web behavior.
- With broad enough reach (e.g., social media buttons), websites can track you across many sites.

## How to Control Cookie Tracking
You can manage your privacy by controlling how cookies are stored and used:

1. **Ignore Tracking**: Some users choose to ignore cookie tracking.
2. **Limit Tracking**:
   - Block third-party cookies or periodically clear cookies from your browser.
   - Use browser privacy settings to limit cookies:
     - Set your browser to not track requests.
     - Block third-party cookies.
     - Clear cookies when you close the browser.

### Potential Issues
- Blocking all cookies can cause some websites to stop working properly.
- You may need to allow certain cookies for websites to function, such as for login or shopping cart features.

### Summary
- **Cookies** track your activity and can be useful but also raise privacy concerns.
- **Third-party cookies** can track you across multiple sites.
- **Managing cookies** can help protect your privacy but may disrupt how some websites work.
