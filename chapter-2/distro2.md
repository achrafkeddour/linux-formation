## Red Hat

Red Hat began as a simple Linux distribution that introduced the **Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)**. The developers later formed a company to commercialize a Linux desktop for businesses. However, Red Hat shifted focus to server applications, like web and file servers. This led to the creation of **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**, a paid service with a long release cycle, which provides stability by updating software less frequently.

Businesses often prefer these longer cycles for stability, while developers or startups might prefer more frequent updates. To meet this need, Red Hat supports the **Fedora Project**, which provides a free desktop with the latest software, built on the same foundation as RHEL.

#### CentOS and Other RHEL-Based Projects
Since **RHEL** is open source, projects like **CentOS** emerged. CentOS recompiles RHEL's open-source packages and offers them for free, though it doesn't provide the paid support that Red Hat offers. CentOS is mostly compatible with RHEL and includes some newer software.

Another example is **Scientific Linux**, a Red Hat-based distribution used for scientific purposes. Sponsored by **Fermilab**, it powers applications like particle accelerators, including the **Large Hadron Collider at CERN**.
