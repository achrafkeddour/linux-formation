## Red Hat

Red Hat began as a simple Linux distribution that introduced the **Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)**. The developers later formed a company to commercialize a Linux desktop for businesses. However, Red Hat shifted focus to server applications, like web and file servers. This led to the creation of **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**, a paid service with a long release cycle, which provides stability by updating software less frequently.

Businesses often prefer these longer cycles for stability, while developers or startups might prefer more frequent updates. To meet this need, Red Hat supports the **Fedora Project**, which provides a free desktop with the latest software, built on the same foundation as RHEL.

#### CentOS and Other RHEL-Based Projects
Since **RHEL** is open source, projects like **CentOS** emerged. CentOS recompiles RHEL's open-source packages and offers them for free, though it doesn't provide the paid support that Red Hat offers. CentOS is mostly compatible with RHEL and includes some newer software.

Another example is **Scientific Linux**, a Red Hat-based distribution used for scientific purposes. Sponsored by **Fermilab**, it powers applications like particle accelerators, including the **Large Hadron Collider at CERN**.

## SUSE
**SUSE** is a Linux distribution originally based on Slackware. After several ownership changes, it became an independent business in 2018. SUSE Linux Enterprise is a server product with some proprietary code, while openSUSE is a free, fully open-source version similar to CentOS.

## Debian
**Debian** is a community-driven Linux distribution that promotes the use of open-source software and adherence to standards. Debian created its own package management system based on the **.deb** file format. Unlike Red Hat, which leaves support for non-Intel and AMD platforms to other projects, Debian supports many platforms directly.

**Ubuntu** is one of the most popular Debian-based distributions, created by Canonical. Canonical provides support services for Ubuntu and offers several versions for different use cases, including desktop, server, and specialized applications. Ubuntu also provides **Long-Term Support (LTS)** versions, which are maintained for 3 years on desktops and 5 years on servers, ensuring stability for developers and businesses.

**Linux Mint** is another popular distribution, originally a fork of Ubuntu. It still relies on the **Ubuntu repositories**. Linux Mint is free to use, with different versions available, some of which include proprietary codecs that might have legal restrictions in certain countries.
