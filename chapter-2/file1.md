# Operating Systems
Modern operating systems do more than just manage hardware and software. 

1. They allow **multiple programs** to run at the same time by sharing the computerâ€™s processor, making it seem like everything happens simultaneously. 
2. They also **provide services** that let users and programs request tasks, like printing a document. If the request is made correctly, the operating system will perform the function needed.

The term **operating system** applies to any **software that is booted and controls a device**, whether it's a basic set-top box or a powerful supercomputer.

- Servers generally run as a CLI, which **frees up resources** for the real purpose of the computer: serving information to clients
- Servers typically sit in a rack and share a keyboard and monitor with many other computers (remote access)
