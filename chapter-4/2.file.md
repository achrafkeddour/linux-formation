# Chapter Summary: Open Source Licensing

## Key Concepts in Software Licensing

- **Ownership**: Intellectual property typically remains with the creator.
- **Money Transfer**: Payment varies by business model; not all software requires payment (One-Time Payment? Subscription? Free with Extras? Completely Free? Pay When You Use? Donations? ).
- **Licensing**: Specifies usage rights and restrictions, it differentiates **Open Source** from **Closed Source** software.

## Open Source vs. Closed Source Licensing

- **Closed Source (e.g., Microsoft Windows)**:
  - **Ownership**: Microsoft retains IP rights.
  - **EULA**: An End-User License Agreement (EULA) is a legal contract between the licensor (the software developer or company) and the licensee (the user) that outlines the rights and restrictions for using the software , prevents copying and modification; Binary-Only (The compiled format , machine code or executable form)  .
  - **Usage**: Licensed per device, no distribution rights.
  - **Source Code**: Not shared with users.

- **Open Source (e.g., Linux under GPLv2)**:
  - **Ownership**: Linus Torvalds; code under **GNU General Public License (GPL)** , ```GPL``` allows anyone to use, change, and share the software for free..
  - **GPLv2 Rights**: With GPLv2, anyone who uses or changes the code **must make their changes public** if they share it with others; modifications allowed and can be redistributed.
  - **Redistribution**: Modifications must stay under GPL, preserving openness (the software open for all) .
  
## Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

- **FOSS Philosophy**: Anyone can view, use, and share the source code. **Foss** is a generall term and can be be licensed under ```MIT License``` or ```Apache License``` or ```GPL License```
- **GNU General Public License (GPL)**:
  - Enforces open distribution and modification rights.
  - **Copyleft**: Modified versions must stay free and open.

## Key Organizations

1. **Free Software Foundation (FSF)**:
   - Founded by **Richard Stallman** in 1985 to promote "freedom" in software use.
   - **Copyleft** philosophy: Any modified software must also remain free.
   - **GPLv2 vs. GPLv3**: Version 3 adds protections against "Tivoization" (restricting modified code on specific hardware).

2. **Open Source Initiative (OSI)**:
   - Founded by **Bruce Perens** and **Eric Raymond** in 1998.
   - Supports open-source software without **copyleft** requirements (e.g., BSD licenses).
   - Focus: Source availability with minimal usage restrictions.

## Types of Licenses

### FSF Licenses (Copyleft)

- **GPLv2** and **GPLv3**: Require shared modifications under the same license.
- **LGPL**: Allows linking to proprietary software with restrictions.

### Permissive Open Source Licenses (OSI)

- **BSD (2-Clause and 3-Clause)**: Redistribution allowed with attribution; no restriction on proprietary use.
- **MIT License**: Similar to BSD, permissive and minimal requirements.

**Terminology**:
- **FOSS**: Free and Open Source Software.
- **FLOSS**: Free/Libre/Open Source Software (emphasizes "libre" as "freedom").

## Creative Commons (CC) Licensing for Non-Software Works

- **Creative Commons (CC)** licenses apply FOSS principles to non-software (art, documents, etc.).
- **Core Conditions**:
  - **Attribution (BY)**: Credit the creator.
  - **ShareAlike (SA)**: Modified works must use the same license.
  - **NonCommercial (NC)**: No commercial use.
  - **NoDerivatives (ND)**: No modifications allowed.

- **Main CC Licenses**:
  - **CC BY**: Free use with attribution.
  - **CC BY-SA**: Attribution + ShareAlike (similar to copyleft).
  - **CC BY-ND**: Attribution, no modifications.
  - **CC BY-NC**: Attribution, non-commercial use only.
  - **CC BY-NC-SA**: Attribution, non-commercial, ShareAlike.
  - **CC BY-NC-ND**: Attribution, non-commercial, no derivatives.
  - **CC0**: No rights reserved, public domain equivalent.

This summary highlights the critical points about open-source licensing, the main organizations involved, and the types of licenses available for both software and non-software works.
