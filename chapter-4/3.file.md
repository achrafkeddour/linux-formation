# Open Source Business Models

## Can Open Source Software Be Profitable?

### Key Points
- **Selling Open Source Software**: The GPL allows selling software; “free” in this context means freedom, not zero cost.
- **Profit Through Added Value**: Companies can monetize by adding value to free software (e.g., through support, warranties).

### Examples of Open Source Business Models

1. **Support and Services**:
   - **Canonical** (Ubuntu) and **Redhat** provide enterprise support for Linux distributions, helping businesses manage systems and products.

2. **Project-Based Expansion**:
   - **Wireshark**: Initially developed as a cost-effective network analysis tool, Wireshark now surpasses many commercial options and supports a company focused on related products and services.

3. **Hardware Bundling**:
   - **Tivo and Similar Devices**: Combine free software with proprietary hardware or software for consumer electronics, from DVRs to IoT devices.

4. **Corporate Involvement**:
   - Companies, both big and small, invest resources in open source projects, influencing and benefiting from developments relevant to their industries.
   - Many businesses also fund open source projects critical to their internal operations.

5. **Cloud and Open Source**:
   - With cloud infrastructure growth, opportunities for open source development and collaboration have expanded, supporting a growing ecosystem of open-source-driven cloud tools.
